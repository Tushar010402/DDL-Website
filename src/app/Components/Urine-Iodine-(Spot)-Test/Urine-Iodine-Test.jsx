          <p className="text-gray-600 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Iodine is a vital trace element that plays a crucial role in the proper functioning of the thyroid gland. Adequate iodine levels are necessary for the production of thyroid hormones, which regulate metabolism, growth, and brain development. Unfortunately, both iodine deficiency and excessive intake can lead to thyroid-related disorders, making accurate monitoring essential.

            The Urine Iodine Test measures the concentration of iodine excreted in a urine sample. Since more than 90% of ingested iodine is eliminated through urine, this test offers an accurate reflection of a person's iodine status. It is widely used in:

          <p className="text-gray-600 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Iodine deficiency remains a global concern, even in urban populations where dietary habits often vary. Low iodine levels can lead to:

            On the other hand, excessive iodine intake can also cause thyroid dysfunction. Therefore, accurate assessment through the Urine Iodine (Spot) Test is essential to strike the right balance.

          <p className="text-gray-600 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The thyroid gland cannot function without iodine. Insufficient iodine leads to inadequate production of thyroid hormones, while excessive iodine can trigger hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Iodine deficiency or excess can pose risks throughout the life cycle and has been linked to mental impairment and thyroid disorders such as goitre, hypothyroidism, or hyperthyroidism in older children and adults.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
            From a functional medicine perspective, iodine status should be assessed in the context of diet and iodized salt use, thyroid function (TSH, free T4), life stage (pregnancy/lactation), and potential excess intake from supplements or seaweed. Following prenatal guidelines for daily iodine intake is recommended while avoiding excessive amounts that may disturb thyroid function. Urinary iodine measurement is widely used for population-level monitoring and individualized testing when clinically indicated.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Adequate iodine intake during pregnancy and lactation is essential to support fetal brain development and infant health.

          <p className="text-gray-600 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
            That's why the Thyroid Iodine Test (via urine sample) is a critical diagnostic tool. It bridges the gap between routine thyroid blood tests and actual nutritional iodine assessment.
