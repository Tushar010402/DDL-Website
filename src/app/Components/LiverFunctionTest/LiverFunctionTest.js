  <h2>Liver Function Test (LFT) in Delhi & Gurgaon</h2>
  <p><strong>Bilirubin (Total):</strong> Bilirubin is a substance produced during normal breakdown of red blood cells. Bilirubin is of two types - direct and indirect. Elevated levels of direct bilirubin might indicate liver damage, obstruction, viral hepatitis, and/or other kinds of liver disorders. Increase in indirect bilirubin levels might be indicative of certain types of anaemia, which include hemolytic anaemia in which there is destruction of a large number of red blood cells, or maybe of no significance (physiological jaundice). Bilirubin is also commonly elevated in newborns and neonates.</p>
  <p><strong>Bilirubin (Direct):</strong> Direct bilirubin is excreted out of your body in the form of bile. Bile pigments give yellowish colour to your stool.</p>
  <p><strong>Bilirubin (Indirect):</strong> Indirect bilirubin is converted to direct bilirubin to facilitate its clearance from the body. Increase in indirect bilirubin may be caused due to hemolysis and certain congenital disorders.</p>
  <p><strong>S.G.O.T. (Serum Glutamic-Oxaloacetic Transaminase):</strong> AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) also known as SGOT is an enzyme found in the liver that helps convert proteins into energy for liver cells. When the liver is damaged, SGOT is released into the bloodstream and the levels might increase. Mild elevations may sometimes be of no significance.</p>
  <p><strong>S.G.P.T (Serum Glutamic - Pyruvic Transaminase):</strong> ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase) also known as SGPT is an enzyme that helps to metabolise amino acids. Like ALT, AST is normally present in blood at low levels. An increase in AST may indicate liver damage, disease or muscle damage. Mild elevations may sometimes be of no significance.</p>
  <p><strong>Alkaline phosphatase, Serum:</strong> This is an enzyme found in the liver and bones and is important for breaking down proteins. Higher than normal levels of ALP may indicate liver damage or disease like blocked bile duct or certain bone disease.</p>
  <p><strong>G.G.T.P. (Serum) (Gamma- glutamyltransferase):</strong> It is the average concentration of haemoglobin in your red blood cells.</p>
  <p><strong>Total Proteins, Serum:</strong> It is the total amount of protein in your blood. A total protein test can give some general information on your health. Low protein levels can indicate liver or kidney disease.</p>
  <p><strong>Albumin, Serum:</strong> Albumin is one of the several proteins made in the liver. Your body needs these proteins to fight infections and perform other functions. Lower than normal levels of albumins and total protein may indicate liver damage or disease. This is also frequently found in certain diets and also in prolonged fasting states. Low albumin levels can also be seen in certain kidney diseases.</p>
  <p><strong>Albumin/ Globulin Ratio, Serum:</strong> Albumin/Globulin ratio is the comparison of the amount of albumin in your blood serum with the amount of globulin in your blood serum.</p>

  <h3>Prevention</h3>
  <p>To prevent liver disease:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Avoid excess alcohol as alcoholic beverages over a period of time destroy your liver cells.</li>
    <li>Use medication wisely. Take prescription and nonprescription drugs only when needed and only in recommended doses. Don't mix medications and alcohol. Talk to your doctor before mixing herbal supplements or prescription and nonprescription drugs.</li>
    <li>Avoid contact with other people’s blood and body fluids. Hepatitis virus can spread by accidental needle sticks or improper cleanup of blood and body fluids.</li>
    <li>Keep your food safe. Wash your hands thoroughly before eating or preparing food. When travelling, use bottled water to drink, wash your hands and brush your teeth. Hepatitis A and E are common causes of liver infection.</li>
    <li>Maintain a healthy weight. Obesity can cause nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Understanding Liver Function Tests (LFTs): Assessing Liver Health</h3>
  <p>Liver Function Tests (LFTs) are a group of blood tests used to assess the overall health and function of the liver. These tests measure various enzymes, proteins, and other substances produced or processed by the liver, providing crucial insights into liver health and potential liver diseases. Liver Function Tests are critical in evaluating liver health, identifying liver disorders, and tracking the treatment efficacy of liver-related conditions.</p>

  <h3>Importance of Liver Function Tests:</h3>
  <p><strong>Liver Health Assessment:</strong> LFTs help evaluate liver health by assessing enzyme levels and protein synthesis.</p>
  <p><strong>Detection of Liver Diseases:</strong> These tests aid in diagnosing various liver conditions, including hepatitis, cirrhosis, fatty liver disease, and others.</p>

  <h3>Principal Parameters of LFT and Their Interpretations:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT):</strong> An enzyme indicative of liver health. Elevated levels often point to liver damage. Abnormal Levels Suggest: Hepatitis, liver injury, fatty liver disease.</li>
    <li><strong>Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST):</strong> Another key liver enzyme. High levels can indicate liver or other organ damage. Abnormal Levels Suggest: Liver cirrhosis, myocardial infarction, muscle injuries.</li>
    <li><strong>Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP):</strong> Enzyme linked to bile duct function. High levels may signal bile duct or liver issues. Abnormal Levels Suggest: Blocked bile ducts, liver cancer, bone disorders.</li>
    <li><strong>Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT):</strong> Enzyme that assists in detecting liver and bile duct problems. Abnormal Levels Suggest: Cholestasis, alcoholic liver disease, pancreatic conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>Total Bilirubin and Direct Bilirubin:</strong> Pigments produced from the breakdown of red blood cells. High levels can indicate liver or gallbladder problems. Abnormal Levels Suggest: Jaundice, gallstones, hepatitis.</li>
    <li><strong>Albumin and Total Protein:</strong> Measures protein levels in the blood, indicative of liver’s synthetic ability. Abnormal Levels Suggest: Chronic liver disease, malnutrition etc.</li>
  </ol>
