  <p><strong>Fast, Accurate and Reliable CBNAAT Testing for Tuberculosis: GeneXpert Test</strong></p>

  <h3>What is CBNAAT?</h3>
  <p>
    The CBNAAT (Cartridge-Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test) provided by Dr. Dangs Lab, also known as the GeneXpert test, is a rapid molecular diagnostic test used to detect tuberculosis (TB) and drug-resistant strains of TB. It is a gold standard test for detecting active TB infections. The test works by analyzing the DNA of the TB bacteria in a sputum sample, providing results within a matter of hours. The CBNAAT test is considered to be one of the most accurate and reliable tests for diagnosing TB. Dr. Dangs Lab has associated with Initiative for Promoting Affordable and Quality TB Tests (IPAQT) to introduce CBNAAT for TB with a vision of providing quality treatment for TB at affordable cost. As a part of this initiative CBNAAT testing is available at Dr. Dangs Lab at affordable price of INR 2200.

  <h3>Who Needs the CBNAAT Test?</h3>
  <p>
    The CBNAAT test is recommended for anyone who has symptoms of TB, such as a persistent cough, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. It is also recommended for anyone who has been in close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with TB, as well as anyone who has a weakened immune system or is at high risk for TB.
  </p>

  <h3>Why Choose CBNAAT?</h3>
  <p>
    If you are experiencing symptoms of TB or have been in close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with TB, it is important to get tested as soon as possible. The CBNAAT test offers several advantages over traditional TB tests:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fast Results:</strong> The CBNAAT test provides results within 2 hours, compared to traditional tests that can take days or even weeks to get results. This means that treatment can begin sooner, reducing the spread of TB and improving outcomes for patients.</li>
    <li><strong>Total Leucocyte Count:</strong> is the count of white blood cells per unit volume of blood. Increased total leucocyte count may be indicative of infections or inflammation, while decreased total leucocyte count may cause a decrease in the body's ability to fight diseases.</li>
    <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> The CBNAAT test is highly accurate, with a sensitivity of over 95% and a specificity of over 98%. This means that false positives and false negatives are rare, ensuring that patients receive the correct diagnosis and treatment.</li>
    <li><strong>Drug Resistance Detection:</strong> The CBNAAT test can detect drug-resistant strains of TB, which is important for choosing the most effective treatment.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Advantages of CBNAAT Test</h3>
  <p>The CBNAAT test has several advantages over traditional TB diagnostic methods, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Faster Diagnosis:</strong> The CBNAAT test can provide accurate results within two hours, allowing healthcare professionals to initiate treatment promptly, preventing the spread of the disease.</li>
    <li><strong>Higher Sensitivity:</strong> The CBNAAT test has a higher sensitivity compared to sputum microscopy, the traditional method of TB diagnosis. The test can detect even small amounts of TB bacteria, making it useful for patients who have a low bacterial load or are HIV-positive.</li>
    <li><strong>Ability to Detect Drug-Resistant TB:</strong> The CBNAAT test can detect drug-resistant TB, which is crucial for selecting the right treatment regimen and preventing the development of further drug resistance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How to Prepare for the CBNAAT Test?</h3>
  <p>
    The CBNAAT test is a simple and painless procedure that involves collecting a sputum sample. Sputum is the mucus that is coughed up from the lungs and throat. To prepare for the CBNAAT test, you will need to provide a sputum sample. Hereâ€™s how you can collect a sputum sample:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Rinse your mouth with water and gargle to clear your throat.</li>
    <li>Take a deep breath and cough deeply to produce sputum.</li>
    <li>Collect the sputum in a clean, dry container.</li>
    <li>Repeat the process until you have enough sputum for the test.</li>
    <li>Label the container with your name, date of birth, and the date of collection.</li>
    <li>Submit the sputum sample to the healthcare provider.</li>
  </ol>
