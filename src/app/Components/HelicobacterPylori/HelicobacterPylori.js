          <p>
            If you often experience acidity after meals, bloating that just
            won't go away, or a nagging burning sensation in your upper stomach,
            it might not just be "something you ate."
          </p>

          <p>
            These could be signs of an H. pylori infectionâ€”a common bacterial
            condition that affects nearly 50% of the world's population.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many people mistake it for simple indigestion or blame it on stress
            or spicy food, but the root cause may be a hidden bacterial
            infection.
          </p>

            What is{" "}
            <span className="italic ">Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)?</span>{" "}
          </h3>
          <p className="mt-3">
            H. pylori is a spiral-shaped bacterium that colonizes the stomach
            lining. It is usually acquired during childhood and can remain
            undetected for years. If left untreated, it can lead to:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
            <li>
              <strong>Chronic gastritis</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>
                Peptic ulcers (painful sores in the stomach or small intestine)
              </strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Persistent acid reflux</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>And in some cases, even gastric cancer</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It's a silent troublemakerâ€”many people don't realize they're
            infected until symptoms become chronic or complications arise.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-bold">Why You Might Need an H. pylori Test</h3>
          <p>
            Have you been taking antacids or home remedies frequently without
            long-term relief?
          </p>
          <p>
            Do you feel bloated after small meals, experience frequent burping,
            or suffer from upper stomach discomfort, even when your diet seems
            fine?
          </p>
          <p>These could be signs of an active H. pylori infection.</p>
          <p>
            If you're constantly reaching for digestive tablets or skipping
            spicy foods because of "acidity," it's time to dig deeper.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-bold ">Symptoms to Watch For:</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Recurring bloating or gas</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Heartburn or acidity (especially at night)</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Frequent burping or reflux</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Upper abdominal pain</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Loss of appetite</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Nausea or vomiting</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Bad breath (halitosis) despite oral hygiene</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>IBS-like symptoms</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fatigue without a clear cause</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Unexplained weight loss</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These symptoms can interfere with your quality of lifeâ€”from
            disrupted sleep due to acid reflux to feeling uncomfortable at work
            after meals.

            Tests for Helicobacter pylori at Dr. Dangs Lab
          </h3>
          <p>
            We offer scientifically validated and non-invasive tests to detect
            active or past H. pylori infection. Tests are recommended based on
            your symptoms, history, and your physician's guidance.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-bold ">1. Urea Breath Test (UBT)</h3>
          <p className="mt-3">
            <strong>Exclusively at Dr. Dangs Lab â€“ Appointment Required</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The UBT is the <strong>gold-standard</strong>, non-invasive test to
            diagnose active H. pylori infection.
          </p>
  <section class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-3">
    <div class="p-2">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">How It Works</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The patient drinks a urea solution containing a special carbon isotope. This is a <strong>completely harmless liquid</strong> that includes urea, a compound naturally present in the body.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        If <span class="italic">Helicobacter pylori</span> is present, it breaks down the urea and releases carbon dioxide, which is then measured in the patient's breath sample.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The entire procedure takes approximately <strong>15â€“20 minutes</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        No blood tests, no discomfortâ€”just a simple drink and breath sample. It's like doing a health check with a sip and a breath.
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Preparation Guidelines</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>Avoid antibiotics, bismuth-containing medications, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for at least 10â€“14 days prior to the test.</strong><br/>
          (Always consult your doctor before stopping any medications.)
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>Fast for at least 6 hours before the test.</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Preparing well helps ensure the test results are accurateâ€”think of it like preparing for a fitness test for your stomach.

            Detects the presence of H. pylori antigens in a stool sample,

          <h3 className="mt-2 ">
            1. Can I eat or drink water before the H. pylori breath test?
          </h3>
          <p>
            <strong>No.</strong> You should fast for at least 6 hours before the
            breath testâ€”this includes no food or water. Fasting ensures the
            results are accurate and not affected by recent intake.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Do I need a doctor's prescription for the H. pylori test?</h3>
          <p>
            While a prescription isn't mandatory for most tests, it's{" "}
            <strong>highly recommended to consult your doctor first</strong>.
            They can help choose the most appropriate test based on your
            symptoms and history.

          <h3>4. Can H. pylori go away on its own without treatment?</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>No.</strong> H. pylori infections usually require a specific
            combination of antibiotics and acid-suppressing medications.
            Ignoring the infection can lead to ulcers, chronic gastritis, or
            even stomach cancer over time.
