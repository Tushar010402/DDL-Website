                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The laboratory subjects itself to continuous and rigorous voluntary ACCREDITATION compliant to GLOBAL ISO 15189 STANDARDS applicable to clinical laboratories through demonstrated competence to achieve quality goals.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We understand that discrepant laboratory results may pose considerable risk to patients and hence, make all possible structured efforts including multiple internal and external laboratory QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE (QC/QA) measures, participation in PROFICIENCY TESTING (PT).

                        <p>We follow excellent Quality Control and Standardisation procedures in all aspects of Laboratory Medicine and this is of fundamental importance for us for the provision of clinical diagnosis and optimal patient-care.</p>
                        <h3>Proficiency Testing</h3>
                        <p>
                            Proficiency testing determines the performance of individual laboratories for specific tests or measurements and is used to monitor laboratories continuing performance. Proficiency testing involves a group of laboratories or analysts performing the same analysis on the same samples and comparing results. The key requirements of such comparisons are that the samples are homogeneous and stable and also that the set of samples analyzed are appropriate to test and display similarities and differences in results. We are committed to performing proficiency testing on a regular basis to ensure the best quality of our services.
