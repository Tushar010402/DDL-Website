          <p>Did you know that Vitamin C is much more than just an immunity booster? </p>
          <p>While it's well known for fighting infections and aiding recovery from colds, what many people don't realize is that Vitamin C plays a vital role in multiple essential bodily functions—ranging from tissue repair and collagen formation to iron absorption and protecting your cells from oxidative stress.</p>
          <p>At Dr. Dangs Lab, one of the best diagnostic labs in Delhi NCR, we offer a highly accurate Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) blood test to assess your nutritional status and prevent long-term health complications.</p>
          <h3>Why Test for Vitamin C?</h3>
          <p>Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, meaning it is not stored in the body and must be replenished regularly through diet or supplements. Low levels can lead to a weakened immune system, poor wound healing, fatigue, and even bleeding gums in severe cases.</p>
          <h3 className="text-gray-900">Testing your Vitamin C levels is particularly important if you:</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
            <li>Experience fatigue, joint pain, or frequent illness</li>
            <li>Have low iron levels even with a balanced, iron-rich diet</li>
            <li>Follow a restricted or low-fruit diet</li>
            <li>Suffer from chronic stress or infections</li>
            <li>Take iron supplements (as Vitamin C aids in iron absorption)</li>
            <li>Smoke or are exposed to secondhand smoke</li>
            <li>Follow a vegetarian/vegan lifestyle</li>
            <li>Are pregnant or breastfeeding</li>
            <li>Have gastrointestinal disorders like IBD or celiac disease</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Early detection of deficiency can help you take the right nutritional steps before complications develop.</p>

          <h3>The Role of Vitamin C in Human Health</h3>
          <p>Vitamin C is not produced by the human body and must be obtained externally. It plays a key role in:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Immunity Boosting:</strong> Enhances immune cell function and helps fight off infections.</li>
            <li><strong>Antioxidant Defense:</strong> Neutralizes free radicals, reducing oxidative stress and lowering the risk of chronic diseases.</li>
            <li><strong>Collagen Production:</strong> Crucial for healthy skin, ligaments, tendons, and blood vessels.</li>
            <li><strong>Heart Health:</strong> Helps maintain blood pressure and reduces arterial stiffness.</li>
            <li><strong>Wound Healing:</strong> Essential for tissue regeneration and recovery.</li>
            <li><strong>Oral Health:</strong> Prevents gum bleeding and maintains oral integrity.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Vitamin C & Iron Absorption – The Critical Connection</h3>
          <p>One of the most critical but often overlooked roles of Vitamin C is its ability to enhance the absorption of non-heme iron (plant-based iron). This is especially important for vegetarians and vegans who rely primarily on plant sources for their iron intake.</p>
          <p>Vitamin C reduces ferric iron (Fe3+) to ferrous iron (Fe2+), a form that is more readily absorbed in the small intestine. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), consuming as little as 25–100 mg of Vitamin C with a meal can increase iron absorption by up to 67%.</p>
          <p><strong>Trusted Reference:</strong> National Institutes of Health, Office of Dietary Supplements. “Vitamin C – Fact Sheet for Health Professionals.” (<a className="text-blue-500" href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/">https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/</a>)</p>
          <p>Deficiency in Vitamin C may lead to poor iron absorption, which in turn can result in iron-deficiency anemia—manifesting as fatigue, weakness, and reduced cognitive function.</p>

          <h3>What to Do When Your Vitamin C is Low:</h3>
          <p>Low levels suggest dietary insufficiency or malabsorption and may require lifestyle changes or supplements under medical supervision.</p>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-5">
            <li><strong>Eat More Vitamin C–Rich Foods:</strong> Include oranges, guava, kiwi, papaya, strawberries, bell peppers, broccoli, and tomatoes in your daily diet.</li>
            <li><strong>Pair with Iron-Rich Foods:</strong> Vitamin C helps your body absorb iron better. Squeeze lemon on dal or have fruit with your meals.</li>
            <li><strong>Take Supplements if Needed:</strong> If your deficiency is significant, your doctor may recommend Vitamin C tablets (usually 250–500 mg/day). Always consult a doctor first.</li>
            <li><strong>Quit Smoking:</strong> Smoking reduces Vitamin C levels. Reducing or quitting helps restore balance.</li>
            <li><strong>Fix Underlying Issues:</strong> Digestive problems can affect absorption. Treating them helps improve Vitamin C levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Retest After Few Weeks:</strong> Check your levels again to see improvement and adjust your plan if needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Consistent:</strong> Eat a healthy, balanced diet regularly to prevent future deficiencies.</li>
          </ol>
