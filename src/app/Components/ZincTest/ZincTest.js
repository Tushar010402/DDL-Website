                    <h3>What is Zinc?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Zinc is an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in various body functions, including
                        wound healing, immune system support, and DNA synthesis. It is vital for growth,
                        development, and overall well-being.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Why is a Zinc Test Important?</h3>
                    <p>
                        A zinc test helps determine if a person has a zinc deficiency, which can be difficult to
                        diagnose based on symptoms alone. A deficiency can lead to several health issues, making it
                        important to check zinc levels through a simple blood test.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Symptoms of Zinc Deficiency:</h3>
                    <p>
                        Zinc deficiency can cause a variety of symptoms, including:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Loss of appetite</li>
                        <li>Reduced sense of taste and smell</li>
                        <li>Slow wound healing</li>
                        <li>Hair loss</li>
                        <li>Diarrhea</li>
                        <li>Weak immune system</li>
                        <li>Delayed growth in children</li>
                        <li>Skin rashes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Certain groups are more prone to zinc deficiency, such as vegetarians, people with digestive
                        disorders, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and individuals with sickle cell disease.
