<h3>What is CBNAAT (Cartridge Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test)?</h3>
<p>
  CBNAAT is a diagnostic tool used to test for the presence of COVID-19. It provides rapid results with high accuracy through an easy-to-use method that can be used for point of care testing for COVID-19. The test uses a machine that can detect the genetic material of the virus from a nasal or oral swab sample. The test has been approved both by US-FDA and CE.
</p>

<h3>How does CBNAAT work?</h3>
<p>
  CBNAAT works by amplifying the genetic material of the COVID-19 virus in a sample. The test uses a cartridge containing reagents and a sample preparation solution. CBNAAT runs more cycles (40 cycles) as compared to the conventional RTPCR test for detection of COVID-19 infection. The solution is mixed with the patient's sample and loaded into the machine. The machine then heats and cools the sample, allowing the virus's genetic material to be amplified and detected. The test results are available in 2-3 hours or less.
</p>

<h3>What are the benefits of CBNAAT testing for COVID-19?</h3>
<p>CBNAAT testing has several benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Rapid results:</strong> CBNAAT tests provide results within 2 hours, allowing for rapid diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 patients.</li>
  <li><strong>High accuracy:</strong> CBNAAT tests are highly accurate as it runs more number of cycles (40 cycles) as compared to the RT-PCR test and can detect even small amounts of the virus in a sample.</li>
  <li><strong>Easy to use:</strong> CBNAAT tests are easy to use and do not require specialized training, making them accessible in many settings.</li>
  <li><strong>Point of care testing:</strong> CBNAAT tests can be performed at the point of care, such as in clinics or hospitals, allowing for quick diagnosis and treatment of patients.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Who should get a CBNAAT test for COVID-19?</h3>
<p>
  CBNAAT testing is recommended for individuals who have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. The test is also recommended for healthcare workers who have been exposed to the virus.
</p>

<h3>How is CBNAAT testing for COVID-19 done?</h3>
<p>
  CBNAAT testing for COVID-19 is done by collecting a nasal or oral swab sample from the patient. The sample is then placed in a cartridge containing the necessary reagents and solution. The cartridge is then loaded into the CBNAAT machine, and the test is run. The results are available in 2 hours or less.
</p>

<h3>What should I do if my CBNAAT test is positive?</h3>
<p>
  If your CBNAAT test is positive, you should self-isolate immediately and seek medical attention. Your healthcare provider will give you guidance on what steps to take next, including treatment and contact tracing.
</p>
<p>
  CBNAAT testing is a valuable tool in the fight against COVID-19. It provides rapid and accurate diagnosis, which is essential for controlling the spread of the virus. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for the virus, you should consider getting a CBNAAT test.
