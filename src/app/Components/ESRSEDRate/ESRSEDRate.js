                    <h3>What is Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) / SED Rate?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), also known as the SED Rate, is a simple blood
                        test that helps detect inflammation in the body. It measures how quickly red blood cells
                        (erythrocytes) settle at the bottom of a test tube over a specific period. When inflammation
                        is present, certain proteins cause red blood cells to clump together and settle faster than
                        normal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the ESR test alone cannot diagnose a specific condition, it is a valuable tool in helping
                        doctors detect and monitor inflammatory diseases. It is often used alongside other tests to
                        get a complete picture of your health.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Why is the ESR Test Done?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Doctors may recommend an ESR test if they suspect you have an inflammatory condition.
                        The test can help:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Detect Inflammation: ESR can identify the presence of inflammation in the body.</li>
                        <li>Monitor Disease Progression: It helps track the progress of inflammatory diseases
                            like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.</li>
                        <li>Evaluate Treatment Response: The test can assess how well treatments are working
                            to reduce inflammation.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Conditions Associated with High ESR Levels</h3>
                    <p>
                        An elevated ESR is a nonspecific marker, meaning it can indicate a variety of conditions,
                        including:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Infections: Bacterial, viral, or fungal infections can cause inflammation.</li>
                        <li>Autoimmune Diseases: Conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and vasculitis.</li>
                        <li>Chronic Diseases: Kidney disease or certain cancers.</li>
                        <li>Injuries: Physical trauma or tissue damage.</li>
                        <li>Old Age: Sometimes, ESR levels may be slightly elevated in the elderly without any
                            specific condition.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Since ESR is a general indicator of inflammation, further tests are often needed to pinpoint
                        the exact cause.
                    </p>

                    <h3>How is the ESR Test Performed?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The ESR test is a simple procedure:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>A healthcare professional will draw a small sample of blood from your vein, usually
                            from your arm.</li>
                        <li>The blood is placed in a test tube and left undisturbed.</li>
                        <li>The rate at which the red blood cells settle at the bottom is measured.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        The entire process takes only a few minutes, and you can return to your normal activities
                        immediately afterward.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Understanding ESR Test Results</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Normal ESR Levels:</strong> These vary based on age, sex, and individual health conditions.
                        Generally:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Men under 50: 0-15 mm/hr</li>
                        <li>Women under 50: 0-20 mm/hr</li>
                        <li>Men over 50: 0-20 mm/hr</li>
                        <li>Women over 50: 0-30 mm/hr</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        These ranges might vary depending on the lab & platform used.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>High ESR Levels:</strong> May indicate inflammation, infection, autoimmune diseases, or other
                        medical conditions. However, it's important to interpret results in conjunction with other
                        clinical findings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Low ESR Levels:</strong> May suggest conditions like heart failure, liver disease, or certain
                        blood disorders.
                    </p>
