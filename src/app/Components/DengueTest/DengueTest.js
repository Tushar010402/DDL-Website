<h3>What is Dengue?</h3>
<p>Dengue is a viral infection caused by the dengue virus, which is primarily transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes, particularly the Aedes aegypti species. It is a widespread disease that affects millions of people worldwide, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. Dengue infection can range from mild flu-like symptoms to severe and potentially life-threatening conditions.</p>
<p>Common symptoms of dengue include high fever, severe headache, joint and muscle pain, rash, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. In some cases, the infection can progress to a more severe form known as dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome, which can cause bleeding, organ failure, and shock.</p>

<h3>How is Dengue Diagnosed?</h3>
<p>Early diagnosis and prompt medical intervention are crucial in managing dengue fever effectively. Healthcare professionals employ various diagnostic methods to confirm dengue infection. These include:</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Evaluation:</strong> Doctors assess the patient's symptoms, medical history, and physical examination to determine the possibility of dengue infection. Common symptoms, such as high fever and rash, may raise suspicion.</p>

<h3>Dengue Testing</h3>
<p>DENGUE NS1 is an automated qualitative assay for the detection of the dengue NS1 antigen in human serum or plasma using the ELFA (Enzyme Linked Fluorescent Assay) technique. It is intended as an aid in the diagnosis of patients with clinical symptoms consistent with dengue infection. The assay principle combines a 2-step sandwich enzyme immunoassay method with a final fluorescence detection (ELFA). ELFA is considered an advanced/automated version of the ELISA method and has an extremely high sensitivity and specificity.</p>
<p>To perform the appropriate tests and increase the chance of accurate DENV infection diagnosis, it is necessary to have information on the date of onset of symptoms. During the early phase (less than 5 days after onset), direct diagnostic techniques are preferred. After the early phase, indirect diagnostic techniques (IgM, IgG) are preferred. Combining NS1 detection with IgM and/or IgG detection in routine diagnosis of DENV infection can help to improve the accuracy of dengue diagnosis. The CDC recommendations for symptomatic patients are the following:</p>
<ol>
    <li>RT-PCR or NS1 and serology (primarily by IgM antibody test) during the first 1-7 days of illness;</li>
    <li>Serology (primarily by IgM antibody test) after &gt;7 days post symptoms onset.</li>
</ol>
