    <h2>Functional Medicine Testing in Delhi and Gurugram</h2>
    <p>Functional medicine is a holistic approach to healthcare that focuses on identifying and addressing the root causes of disease. It goes beyond traditional diagnostics to look at the whole person, including their lifestyle, diet, environment, and genetics.</p>

        <li>Nutrient levels</li>
        <li>Toxic levels of various metals/moulds etc</li>
