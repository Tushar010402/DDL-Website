            Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus belonging to the herpesvirus family that can cause serious complications, especially in immunocompromised individuals such as transplant recipients, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, or those living with HIV. Monitoring CMV activity is crucial in clinical practice, as the virus can remain latent in the body and reactivate when the immune system is weakened.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The CMV DNA viral load test in delhi using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is one of the most reliable methods to detect and quantify CMV DNA in patient samples. This test not only confirms the presence of the virus but also measures the viral load, helping doctors determine the severity of infection and evaluate the effectiveness of ongoing antiviral treatment.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
            At <Link href="https://www.drdangslab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-500 underline">Dr. Dangs Lab</Link>, we provide the Cytomegalovirus PCR test with high accuracy and quick turnaround times.

            What is the CMV DNA Quantitative/Viral Load RT-PCR Test?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The CMV RT-PCR test is a specialized molecular test that detects and quantifies the genetic material (DNA) of the cytomegalovirus. Unlike conventional antibody tests that only indicate exposure, this test identifies active viral replication.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
            By measuring the CMV DNA quantification, clinicians gain insight into whether the infection is active, reactivating, or controlled. The test is especially important for patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy, organ transplant recipients, newborns suspected of congenital CMV infection, and those with unexplained prolonged fever or neurological complications.

          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Monitoring CMV infections is critical because the virus can remain dormant and cause serious health issues when reactivated. The CMV viral load RT-PCR Delhi testing facility at Dr. Dangs Lab offers clinicians a powerful tool for:

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
            <li className="text-gray-600 mb-2"><strong>Early Detection</strong> – Identifying CMV DNA in blood or CSF before clinical symptoms become severe.</li>

          </ul>
          <p className="text-gray-600 text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The test has revolutionized cytomegalovirus diagnosis by offering quantitative, highly sensitive results that directly impact patient management.
