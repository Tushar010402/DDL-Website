<h3>A brief on IgE</h3>
<p>
  This test determines the presence of an allergic reaction. The body produces a specific type of IgE antibody for each antigen. Levels are seen to be at about or above that of 10x of the upper biological reference range when there is an ongoing acute allergic reaction. Total IgE test is the total amount of IgE in your blood; however, it does not determine specific antibodies for particular types of allergens. To decipher if you are allergic to specific allergens, an immediate allergy (food & respiratory panel) test is available.
