                        <h3>Proficiency Testing</h3>
                        <p>
                            Proficiency testing determines the performance of individual laboratories for specific tests or measurements and is used to monitor laboratories continuing performance. Proficiency testing involves a group of laboratories or analysts performing the same analysis on the same samples and comparing results. The key requirements of such comparisons are that the samples are homogeneous and stable and also that the set of samples analyzed are appropriate to test and display similarities and differences in results. We are committed to performing proficiency testing on a regular basis to ensure the best quality of our services.
